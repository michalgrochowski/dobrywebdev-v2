  "aboutDescription": "And I am a <span class=\"myAge\"></span> year old Front-end developer from Warsaw. I've always been fascinated with development of websites and appliactions, and so I've decided to change that interest into a career. Despite aquiring quite a lot of knowledge in a relatively short time I'm not resting on laurels and I'm constantly expanding my skill set, so I can write better code and create more complicated projects. I'm a huge fan of BEM methodology, semantics and flat specificity, also in web design I prefer simplicity and minimalism over fireworks and unnecesary animations.",
