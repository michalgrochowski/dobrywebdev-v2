# dobrywebdev v2

This is the second version of my portfolio page, where I share all of my projects.
Built with:
- HTML5,
- CSS3 (Flexbox),
- jQuery,
- OwlCarousel 2.0 - https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/,
- PHPmailer,
- Fontello and Devicons font icons.

Cool features:
- You can change the theme (dark or light) and the theme settings are saved in your localStorage,
- Language changes via AJAX and JSON files with specific texts,
- Form validation made using RegExp with jQuery without any external library,
- Based on a time of day you get a different welcome text and loading overlay background color.
- In v3.0 I've turned this website to PWA and now it is even faster than before - pretty cool if you ask me. 
- In v 3.1 I've added a function that displays how odl am I in "About" section and current year in footer.
